 -Last commit while working from class did not work, Readme not saved either,
  earlier updated layout for application to reflect Relaxed Seating, had an issue with migrating and updating
  database, recieved help from Andrww, Eric and Abdullah: I needed to specify the context of which database
  to update.

 another field.
